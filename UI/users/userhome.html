	<h1>WELCOME USER</h1>
	<p>To our surprise, corruption has sold our conscientiousness; we have become blind to see in our surroundings the poeple who are straying without clothes, living without shelter and dying in starvation. Everyday, hundreds of poor roam into the streets to find reminant food. <br><br> iReporter enables you to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public  </p>

			<p>Corruption can lead to dissatisfaction and distrust in leaders, public institutions and the rule of law and in most cases, it can lead to spirals of anger and unrest. With corruprion funds that should be dedicted to schools, clean water, health care, sanitation and other vital services are diverted into the hands of criminals or dishonest officials. The victim is the future of our children.</p>

			<p>The current report of poverty is that one in three Nigerians live below the poverty line. if we do not cure this disease now then it shall devour us completely. It is high time to say no corruption and eradicate poverty from our society. Corruption is the root of all evils. if we say no to corruption then it means we say no to poverty</p>
